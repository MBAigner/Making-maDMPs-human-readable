<h1>DMP for the ''Effect-GlobalTemperature-NumberOfBirthsVienna''-project - Detailed DMP</h1>
<hr />

<p />
<h4>1. Data summary</h4>
<p />The aim of this pseudo project is to analyze the relation between the global temperature change and the number of children born alive in Vienna. The experiment is conducted, by means of visual data science (exploring the data by plotting it in an appropriate manner). <p />Dataset - mergedData: Internally generated dataset, that was merge from two external datasets.<p />The distribution mergedData of the dataset is provided in the format csv and is 362bytes large.<p /><p /><p />
<p />
<h4>2.1 Making data findable, including provisions for metadata [FAIR data]</h4>
<p />The dataset mergedData uses the following standard (referenced by URL) http://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/.<p />The metadata is in English. The metadata Provides an explanation of the columns of the dataset. The contact person of the project is Aleksandar Pavlovic. They can be reached on the mail e01525707@student.tuwien.ac.at. Their HTTP-ORCID is https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6887-9515.File naming conventions (separation by underscores) were used. Furthermore a GitHub repository was used for data versioning. Also metadata was provided for this dataset, since it was internally generated.<p />The dataset mergedData can be identified using 10.5281/zenodo.2648703, which is an HTTP-DOI.<p />The dataset is in english. It can be found using the following keywords: "mean near surface temperature deviation", "number of live-births in Vienna".<p />The selected repository (GitHub repository) provides versioning.<p />The host can be identified with 10.5281/zenodo.1209833. Furthermore the host is certified with CoreTrustSeal.<p />The DataManager(Aleksandar Pavlovic, e01525707@student) is identified by 0000-0001-6887-9515(ORCID).<p />The ProjectLeader(Aleksandar Pavlovic, e01525707@student) is identified by 0000-0001-6887-9515(ORCID).<p />The dmp is identified by 10.5281/zenodo.2648805.<p />It will be funded by 501100002428 (FUNDREF).<p />The funding has been granted. The grant is identified by 1234567 (custom).<p /><p />
<p />
<p />
<h4>2.2 Making data openly accessible [FAIR data]</h4>
<p />Should be preserved for a maximum of about 2 to 5 years, as it will get very outdated and presumably of only little interest to the public afterwards.<p />The dataset does not contain personal data.<p />The dataset does not contain sensitive data.<p />Data write access control:<p />The data is safely stored in a public GitHub repository.One can access the data through https://zenodo.org/record/2648703#.XRkCdW5uLD4. The data will be available as open data. The dataset will be available until 2019-08-31. One can download the data from https://zenodo.org/record/2648703#.XRkCdW5uLD4.<p />The dataset is licensed under https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT starting at 2019-04-22.<p />Dataset - mergedData: Internally generated dataset, that was merge from two external datasets.<p />The distribution mergedData of the dataset is provided in the format csv and is 362bytes large.<p /><p />The selected repository (GitHub repository) provides versioning.<p />The host can be identified with 10.5281/zenodo.1209833.

<p />
<h4>2.3 Making data interoperable [FAIR data]</h4>
<p />The dataset mergedData uses the following standard (referenced by URL) http://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/.<p />File naming conventions (separation by underscores) were used. Furthermore a GitHub repository was used for data versioning. Also metadata was provided for this dataset, since it was internally generated.<p /><p />
<p />
<h4>2.4 Increase data re-use (through clarifying licenses) [FAIR data]</h4>
<p />File naming conventions (separation by underscores) were used. Furthermore a GitHub repository was used for data versioning. Also metadata was provided for this dataset, since it was internally generated.<p />The dataset is licensed under https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT starting at 2019-04-22.<p />Data write access control:<p />The data is safely stored in a public GitHub repository.The dataset will be available until 2019-08-31.<p /><p />
<p />
<h4>3. Allocation of resources</h4>
<p />There will be costs for Storage and backup (Costs for maintaining the data). These procedures will cost 1000EUR.<p />The DataManager(Aleksandar Pavlovic, e01525707@student) is identified by 0000-0001-6887-9515(ORCID).<p />The ProjectLeader(Aleksandar Pavlovic, e01525707@student) is identified by 0000-0001-6887-9515(ORCID).<p />Should be preserved for a maximum of about 2 to 5 years, as it will get very outdated and presumably of only little interest to the public afterwards.<p /><p />
