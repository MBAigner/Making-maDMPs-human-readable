			<td>Dataset - Combined data of the yearly average temperature of Innsbruck and the pollution emissions of NMVOCs from transport in Austria: This output contains the combined data from the average temperature and per year from Inssbruck and the EU pollution index for NMVOCs of Austria. Each row contains comma-separated values (year;avg yearly temperature;pollution indicator for NMVOCs). The temperature is measured in Celsius degrees. The pollution indicator shows the value of the EU pollution index for NMVOCs (based on year 200, where indicator=100).
The distribution Combined data of the yearly average temperature of Innsbruck and the pollution emissions of NMVOCs from transport in Austria of the dataset is provided in the format csv and is 60000bytes large.

The selected repository (GitHub repository) provides versioning.

			<td>The dataset Combined data of the yearly average temperature of Innsbruck and the pollution emissions of NMVOCs from transport in Austria can be identified using https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2648172, which is an HTTP-DOI.
The dataset is in english. It can be found using the following keywords: "temperature in Innsbruck", "transport pollution emission indicator,".
The metadata is in English. The metadata Meta data is stored under /documentation/metadata.xml and contains the following information: Title of the experiment, Creator, Subject, A more detailed description of the experiment, Date when the experiment was executed, Type/purpose of the application, Format,Sources used, Language, Years covered by the experiment dtaa, Rights for using the data / sourcecode (we provide free access here). As a standard for writing the meta data, the Dublin Core has been in use, since it is a basic, domain-agnostic standard which can be easily understood and implemented. The meta data as well as the description file is created by hand. The data will be stored as a comma-separated values (.csv) file. The format is chosen since it is a non-proprietary, open format for storing data. Also, the resulting file size is smaller than for e.g. XML-files. Figure data will be stored as JPEG files, to make it easier to work with them on different systems and also save disc space. The data collected contains meta data attached in the described origin of the resources.
The selected repository (GitHub repository) provides versioning.
The host can be identified with https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2648176. The data is backed up monthly on hard disc.

The dataset does not contain sensitive data.
There are no ethical issues in the project to be considered.Because the data collected and created contains no information about certain individuals, just averaged temperature values and the emission from transport indicator without reference to any human contributors or institutions causing the emissions, the data does not need to be anonymized. Therefore also no security issues of transferring and storing the data publically are addressed here.Permissions for sharing and publishing the data are ensured since the data collected was published under the CC-BY licence.
