# Making-maDMPs-human-readable

## Overview

..

## Folder Structure

*  ```templates```: Contains template files that will be feeded with maDMP data when executing our tool.
*  ```hrDMPs```: Here we saved some sample human-readable DMPs created with the tool.
*  ```maDMPs```: Contains our created maDMPs, used for the evaluation of our tool.
*  ```scripts```: This folder consists of all code needed for the execution of the tool.

## Instructions

The main file of our tool can be found in the directory  ```scripts```. In the following, we will show up needed software and libraries for the execution of our tool.

### Needed libraries and pre-installed software

* ```python``` version 3.6
* ```tkinter``` version ..
* ```json``` version ..
* ```jinja2``` version 2.10.1
* ```pdfkit``` version 0.6.1

Also, the software  ```wkhtmltopdf ``` needs to be installed, for the creation of pdf documents. Guides how to install this on a certain operating system can be found [here](https://github.com/JazzCore/python-pdfkit/wiki/Installing-wkhtmltopdf/). We used version 0.12.4 for our project.

## Sample maDMPs

The machine-actionable DMPs used for the evaluation of our tool can be used [here](https://github.com/MBAigner/Making-maDMPs-human-readable/tree/master/maDMPs).

## Parsing scheme

Can be found here.

## Sample hrDMPs

The human-readable DMPs created with our tool can be found under [this](https://github.com/MBAigner/Making-maDMPs-human-readable/tree/master/hrDMPs) link.

## Comparison of DMPs

A detailed comparison between the created, human-readable DMPs and the original versions of them can be found here.
