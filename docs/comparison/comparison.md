# Comparison of original DMPs with the generated ones

We want to divide our comparison of the differences of the orginal DMPs and our translated ones into two sections, one for each template - Horizon 2020 and FWF - we treated in our work.

## 1. FWF

### 1.a. How do they differ?
TODO

### 1.b. What information got lost?

We have not been able to include the following information of our original DMPs:

*
*

### 1.c. Which information is more detailed?
TODO

### 1.d. Which parts of the maDMP were easy/hard to generate?
TODO


## 2. Horizon 2020

### 2.a. How do they differ?
TODO

### 2.b. What information got lost?

We have not been able to include the following information of our original DMPs:

*
*

### 2.c. Which information is more detailed?
TODO

### 2.d. Which parts of the maDMP were easy/hard to generate?
TODO


## Solutions according the problems

We implemented the possibility for a user of our tool to manually adjust the resulting human-readable DMP. Thus, formulations can be changed, and missing information can be still added by hand.
