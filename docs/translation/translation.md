# Translation Scheme of maDMPs into hrDMPs

Here, we want to give an overview about the characteristics we used for a conversion from machine-actionable into human-readable DMPs.

We built two different coding schemes, one for each template:

* [FWF](https://github.com/MBAigner/Making-maDMPs-human-readable/blob/master/docs/translation/translation_fwf.md)
* [Horizon 2020](https://github.com/MBAigner/Making-maDMPs-human-readable/blob/master/docs/translation/translation_horizon.md)

More details can be found under the according sections. For both templates, we consider the questions contained in the template, and show which attributes we have used to fill in the necessary information (if such attributes are available).

The translation in our case works by taking those values of the maDMPs if available, and build sentences using them. Information that is not provided by a certain maDMP will be left out, but can be added by the users over our GUI.
