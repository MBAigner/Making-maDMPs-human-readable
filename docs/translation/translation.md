# Translation Scheme of maDMPs into hrDMPs

Here, we want to give an overview about the characteristics we used for a conversion from machine-actionable into human-readable DMPs.

We built two different coding schemes, one for each template:

* [FWF](https://github.com/MBAigner/Making-maDMPs-human-readable/blob/master/docs/translation/translation_fwf.md)
* [Horizon 2020](https://github.com/MBAigner/Making-maDMPs-human-readable/blob/master/docs/translation/translation_horizon.md)

More details can be found under the according sections.
